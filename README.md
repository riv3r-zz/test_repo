Test_repo
=========

###### This is a test repo for playing with Git / GitHub to learn how it all works without breaking a project repo that i'm working on.

Notes will be uploaded to this repo to document the learning process of Git / GitHub.

To Learn:

- [x] Configure Git on local machine (no GUI)
- [x] 101: Clone, Fork, Add, Commit, Remove a file from a commit (Reset HEAD <file>), Push changes, Synch a repo (pull), GitHub markdown
- [ ] Best Practices for open source development (i.e.: commit messages, bug reports, ect...)
- [ ] Logging, Ignore files / Purpose, General repo maintenence
- [ ] How to stop local files from being overwritten when you synch a repo [Stash?]
- [ ] What is Branching and Merging? How to handle branch / merge, dangers of merging branches, ect...

More learning topics to come as I dive deeper ~~or sink deeper~~
